<p>Rakethopp is Swedish for rocket jump, once a gameplay exploit popularized in Doom and Quake, now a core aspect of gameplay in games such as Team Fortress 2.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>The players created a new gameplay mechanic by exploiting a bug in the physics system, and it's now a common move recognised by all. It's a cool bit of emergent, player-influenced game design.</p>\

<p>As a child of the eighties, born about the time Super Mario Bros started conquering the world, I've been playing video games all my life.&nbsp;</p>\

<p>My love for escapism and other worlds let me towards the aerospace industry and an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.squid-kth.se/">(over)ambitious space experiment</a>&nbsp;(which didn't actually end in tears!). I wasn't happy though, and realized I needed to fill my life with more creative pursuits that could affect people on a more personal level.</p>\
<p>The indie movement was growing, my love for games grew stronger than ever and I found this awesome thing called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design">Interaction Design</a>. So I jumped industries, applied for the master's programme at Chalmers in Gothenburg,&nbsp;and started making as many games and visiting as many game jams as I possibly could. &nbsp;As I go along in I'm updating this site with both design projects in school and game making in my free time.</p>\
